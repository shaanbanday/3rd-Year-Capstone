# Pick-and-Place Crane Robot 🤖🏗️

Arduino-controlled crane robot developed for a third-year Mechanical Engineering capstone project. The system fulfills a pick-and-place objective using a simple, robust crane-style mechanical design.

## Overview
The robot performs controlled lifting and horizontal translation to move objects within a fixed workspace. Motion is coordinated using an Arduino with basic limit-switch feedback and state-based control logic.

## Key Features
- Vertical lift and horizontal translation  
- Arduino-based motor control  
- Limit switch homing and travel limits  
- Modular, readable control code
